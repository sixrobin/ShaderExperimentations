# Shader Experimentations
Shader stuff experimentation using Unity Shader Bible book and some other resources. Also includes some personal testing stuff.

Here's some gifs of what's inside the project. Please keep in mind that nothing is made to be fully working for a game, everything is purely testing.

## Shader balls with many different effects
Some of the effects can only be seen by changing parameters directly on the materials, which is why some of these spheres may seem strange.
